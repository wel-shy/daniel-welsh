            "My PhD thesis centred on supporting mental wellbeing in later life, through the presentation and use of media. This is approached through creating technologies using a sensitive experience-centred design approach. To realise this, I have created and deployed technological artefacts using technologies such as: 3D printing, web applications, and developing mobile applications. As such I have developed a strong skillset in frontend and backend development as well as managing a project as a whole. As part of my PhD I have worked with care homes in the UK and Ireland, became a member of the steering group of a local dementia charity, consulted with the Red Cross on their interaction design processes, collaborated across disciplines and institutions, and presented and published at prestigious conferences.",

Between my undergraduate and master’s degree I also interned at Open Lab to develop a cross-platform mobile application, encouraging conversation between younger people and people with dementia. During this project, I lead the application design and development in a co-design process with younger carers of people with dementia. I have been the technological lead on most of these projects using technologies such as: Vue.js, Wordpress, Node.js, TypeScript, Nginx, Docker, MongoDB. Examples of my work can be found in the papers cited below where I developed the technologies they’re centred on."
