      "During my undergraduate degree, I learnt a diverse range of skills in computing science, including software design, web and app development, and human computer interaction. I used these skills to co-design a web application with older people. This system helped older people facing age related conditions share healthy recipes with other people who have similar dietary requirements. Furthermore, I learnt the fundamentals of software development practices, designing algorithms, system security, cryptography and fault tolerances.",

      "This Masters focussed on developing technologies to aid social care. I conducted research into how technology can support intergenerational interactions between young people and people with dementia. As part of this I developed a mobile application called Ticket to Talk. I learnt to work closely with families and people with dementia in a user-centred design process, as well as care homes, and local charities to evaluate and improve the technology. ESRC and Newcastle University ran a full press release on the project, as well the UKâ€™s Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy including the app in their latest industrial campaign. In I developed skills in developing ubiquitous technologies, peer programming, and mobile development.",

      "I studied at Open Lab, Newcastle University, the third largest biggest Human Computer Interaction research group. My PhD thesis centred on supporting mental wellbeing in later life, through the presentation and use of media. This was achieved through creating tech- nologies using a sensitive experience-centred design approach. To realise this, I created and deployed technologies such as: 3D printed devices, web applications, and mobile applications. I developed a strong skillset in development, research, design, independent learning, and project management. As part of my PhD I have worked with care homes in the UK and Ireland, became a member of the steering group of a local dementia charity, consulted with the Red Cross on their interaction design processes, collaborated across disciplines and institutions, and presented and published at prestigious conferences.",
