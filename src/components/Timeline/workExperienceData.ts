      "My PhD thesis centred on supporting mental wellbeing in later life, through the presentation and use of media. This is approached through creating technologies using a sensitive experience-centred design approach. To realise this, I have created and deployed technological artefacts using technologies such as: 3D printing, web applications, and developing mobile applications. As such I have developed a strong skillset in frontend and backend development as well as managing a project as a whole. As part of my PhD I have worked with care homes in the UK and Ireland, became a member of the steering group of a local dementia charity, consulted with the Red Cross on their interaction design processes, collaborated across disciplines and institutions, and presented and published at prestigious conferences.",

          "During my PhD I have consulted and freelanced as a software engineer on a number of research projects. I have developed websites, created a web application for women’s rights activists, and helped create wearable technologies that help people in later life cope with death and grief. Between my undergraduate and master’s degree I also interned at Open Lab to develop a cross-platform mobile application, encouraging conversation between younger people and people with dementia. During this project, I lead the application design and development in a co-design process with younger carers of people with dementia. I have been the technological lead on most of these projects using technologies such as: Vue.js, Wordpress, Node.js, TypeScript, Nginx, Docker, MongoDB. Examples of my work can be found in the papers cited below where I developed the technologies they’re centred on.",
